# Phy160-QML
Harvard 22 Spring PHY 160 final project, about quantum machine learning

We are trying to investigate the paper [Gao, Xun, et al. "Enhancing generative models via quantum correlations." arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.08354 (2021).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08354), about how a minimal quantum extension of bayesian network model could give rise to the expressive power.
